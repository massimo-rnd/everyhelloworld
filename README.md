## Have you ever wondered...
... how the classic "Hello World" program is written in different languages? If you did, then this is perfect for you.

No more endless searching. Get all the information you need from this repository.

## Why does this exist?
Very good question. And to be honest, I don't really know. I had this idea in the middle of the night, and I wanted to do it.

## What is this for?
Well, if you want to get started with a new language, then "Hello World" is the first thing to do. And for whatever language you want to get started with, there is a example in this repository.

## What about [Insert language here]? Why is it missing?!
Well, I am still working on completing this repo. It will take some time, but I'll do my best to complete this ASAP.

## How can I help?
Well, If you'd like to contribute a hello world in a language that isn't listed here yet, feel free to do so! I am happy about every pull request.
